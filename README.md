# park
Automatically register parking lot info (number of cars, license plates, etc.)

Parking lots are necessary, even though there are probably too many of them in the USA (`https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2019/11/27/parking-dominates-our-cities-but-do-we-really-see-it`). This repo documents an attempt to generate all the info necessary for a parking lot operator through computer vision. This would theoretically be a decent business idea (even reducing, three parking lot prowlers to two, for instance, would be worth it), but it is not world-changing and I would rather have some of my recent work up for recruiters and possible coworkers to look at.
